# ecuation_system_solver
Given an ecuation sistem, prints a NumPy Array with the solution
The input:
If the system is x+y=3, x-y=1, in the prompt you enter the first ecuation as 1, 1, 3
Then hit enter and you enter the second ecuation as 1, -1, 1
When the system asks for another ecuation, just hit enter.
The output:
In the example it wil print the output
\[2. 1.]
The first number will be the value of x, and the second, the value of y
Notes:
-This works for any number of unknowns in the ecuation system.
-You have to enter the coefficients always in the same unknowns order.
