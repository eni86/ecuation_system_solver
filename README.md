<h1 align="Center"> Ecuation Systems Solver using Numpy  </h1>
<p> Given an ecuation sistem, prints a NumPy Array with the solution </p> 
<p> The input:</p> 
<p> If the system is x+y=3, x-y=1, in the prompt you enter the first ecuation as 1, 1, 3 </p> 
<p> Then hit enter and you enter the second ecuation as 1, -1, 1 </p> 
<p> When the system asks for another ecuation, just hit enter. </p> 
<p> The output:</p> 
<p> In the example it wil print the output [2. 1.] </p> 
<p> The first number will be the value of x, and the second, the value of y. </p> 
<p> Notes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>This works for any number of unknowns in the ecuation system. </li>
  <li>You have to enter the coefficients always in the same unknowns order. </li>
</ul>
